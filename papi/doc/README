This directory contains:

A collection of files to aid in the preparation of PAPI doxygen documentation.
Beginning with PAPI 4.2.0, doxygen and an on-line wiki are the two primary
sources of documentation. Man pages generated from doxygen can be found in the
man directories and installed on your system. A PAPI Overview and html versions
of the man pages can also be found online at:
