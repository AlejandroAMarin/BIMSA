# Configuration options related to the preprocessor
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# If the ENABLE_PREPROCESSING tag is set to YES (the default) Doxygen will
# evaluate all C-preprocessor directives found in the sources and include
# files.

ENABLE_PREPROCESSING   = YES

# If the MACRO_EXPANSION tag is set to YES Doxygen will expand all macro
# names in the source code. If set to NO (the default) only conditional
# compilation will be performed. Macro expansion can be done in a controlled
# way by setting EXPAND_ONLY_PREDEF to YES.

MACRO_EXPANSION        = YES

# If the EXPAND_ONLY_PREDEF and MACRO_EXPANSION tags are both set to YES
# then the macro expansion is limited to the macros specified with the
# PREDEFINED and EXPAND_AS_DEFINED tags.

EXPAND_ONLY_PREDEF     = YES

# The PREDEFINED tag can be used to specify one or more macro names that
# are defined before the preprocessor is started (similar to the -D option of
# gcc). The argument of the tag is a list of macros of the form: name
# or name=definition (no spaces). If the definition and the = are
# omitted =1 is assumed. To prevent a macro definition from being
# undefined via #undef or recursively expanded use the := operator
# instead of the = operator.

PREDEFINED             = DEBUG

# If the MACRO_EXPANSION and EXPAND_ONLY_PREDEF tags are set to YES then
# this tag can be used to specify a list of macro names that should be expanded.
# The macro definition that is found in the sources will be used.
# Use the PREDEFINED tag if you want to use a different macro definition that
# overrules the definition found in the source code.

# Build related configuration options
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# If the CREATE_SUBDIRS tag is set to YES, then doxygen will create
# 4096 sub-directories (in 2 levels) under the output directory of each output
# format and will distribute the generated files over these directories.
# Enabling this option can be useful when feeding doxygen a huge amount of
# source files, where putting all generated files in the same directory would
# otherwise cause performance problems for the file system.

CREATE_SUBDIRS         = YES

# If the EXTRACT_ALL tag is set to YES doxygen will assume all entities in
# documentation are documented, even if no documentation was available.
# Private class members and static file members will be hidden unless
# the EXTRACT_PRIVATE and EXTRACT_STATIC tags are set to YES

EXTRACT_ALL            = YES 

# If the EXTRACT_STATIC tag is set to YES all static members of a file
# will be included in the documentation.

EXTRACT_STATIC         = YES

# The INTERNAL_DOCS tag determines if documentation
# that is typed after a \internal command is included. If the tag is set
# to NO (the default) then the documentation will be excluded.
# Set it to YES to include the internal documentation.

INTERNAL_DOCS          = YES

# If the CASE_SENSE_NAMES tag is set to NO then Doxygen will only generate
# file names in lower-case letters. If set to YES upper-case letters are also
# allowed. This is useful if you have classes or files whose names only differ
# in case and if your file system supports case sensitive file names. Windows
# and Mac users are advised to set this option to NO.

CASE_SENSE_NAMES       = YES

# The GENERATE_TODOLIST tag can be used to enable (YES) or
# disable (NO) the todo list. This list is created by putting \todo
# commands in the documentation.

GENERATE_TODOLIST      = YES

# The GENERATE_TESTLIST tag can be used to enable (YES) or
# disable (NO) the test list. This list is created by putting \test
# commands in the documentation.

# The GENERATE_BUGLIST tag can be used to enable (YES) or
# disable (NO) the bug list. This list is created by putting \bug
# commands in the documentation.

GENERATE_BUGLIST       = YES

# The GENERATE_DEPRECATEDLIST tag can be used to enable (YES) or
# disable (NO) the deprecated list. This list is created by putting
# \deprecated commands in the documentation.

GENERATE_DEPRECATEDLIST= YES

# Set the SHOW_USED_FILES tag to NO to disable the list of files generated
# at the bottom of the documentation of classes and structs. If set to YES the
# list will mention the files that were used to generate the documentation.

SHOW_USED_FILES        = YES

# If the sources in your project are distributed over multiple directories
# then setting the SHOW_DIRECTORIES tag to YES will show the directory hierarchy
# in the documentation. The default is NO.

SHOW_DIRECTORIES       = NO 

# Set the SHOW_FILES tag to NO to disable the generation of the Files page.
# This will remove the Files entry from the Quick Index and from the
# Folder Tree View (if specified). The default is YES.

SHOW_FILES             = YES

# Set the SHOW_NAMESPACES tag to NO to disable the generation of the
# Namespaces page.
# This will remove the Namespaces entry from the Quick Index
# and from the Folder Tree View (if specified). The default is YES.

SHOW_NAMESPACES        = YES

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# configuration options related to the input files
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The INPUT tag can be used to specify the files and/or directories that contain
# documented source files. You may enter file names like "myfile.cpp" or
# directories like "/usr/src/myproject". Separate the files or directories
# with spaces.

INPUT                  = ../src ../src/components/README

# The RECURSIVE tag can be used to turn specify whether or not subdirectories
# should be searched for input files as well. Possible values are YES and NO.
# If left blank NO is used.

RECURSIVE              = YES

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# configuration options related to source browsing
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# If the SOURCE_BROWSER tag is set to YES then a list of source files will
# be generated. Documented entities will be cross-referenced with these sources.
# Note: To get rid of all source code in the generated output, make sure also
# VERBATIM_HEADERS is set to NO.

SOURCE_BROWSER         = YES 

# Setting the INLINE_SOURCES tag to YES will include the body
# of functions and classes directly in the documentation.

INLINE_SOURCES         = YES 

# Setting the STRIP_CODE_COMMENTS tag to YES (the default) will instruct
# doxygen to hide any special comment blocks from generated source code
# fragments. Normal C and C++ comments will always remain visible.

STRIP_CODE_COMMENTS    = YES

# If the REFERENCED_BY_RELATION tag is set to YES
# then for each documented function all documented
# functions referencing it will be listed.

REFERENCED_BY_RELATION = NO

# If the REFERENCES_RELATION tag is set to YES
# then for each documented function all documented entities
# called/used by that function will be listed.

REFERENCES_RELATION    = NO

# If the REFERENCES_LINK_SOURCE tag is set to YES (the default)
# and SOURCE_BROWSER tag is set to YES, then the hyperlinks from
# functions in REFERENCES_RELATION and REFERENCED_BY_RELATION lists will
# link to the source code.
# Otherwise they will link to the documentation.

REFERENCES_LINK_SOURCE = YES

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# configuration options related to the HTML output
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# If the GENERATE_HTML tag is set to YES (the default) Doxygen will
# generate HTML output.

GENERATE_HTML          = YES

# The HTML_OUTPUT tag is used to specify where the HTML docs will be put.
# If a relative path is entered the value of OUTPUT_DIRECTORY will be
# put in front of it. If left blank `html' will be used as the default path.

HTML_OUTPUT            = html

# The HTML_FILE_EXTENSION tag can be used to specify the file extension for
# each generated HTML page (for example: .htm,.php,.asp). If it is left blank
# doxygen will generate files with .html extension.

HTML_FILE_EXTENSION    = .html

# The HTML_HEADER tag can be used to specify a personal HTML header for
# each generated HTML page. If it is left blank doxygen will generate a
# standard header.

HTML_HEADER            =

# The HTML_FOOTER tag can be used to specify a personal HTML footer for
# each generated HTML page. If it is left blank doxygen will generate a
# standard footer.

HTML_FOOTER            =

# The HTML_STYLESHEET tag can be used to specify a user-defined cascading
# style sheet that is used by each HTML page. It can be used to
# fine-tune the look of the HTML output. If the tag is left blank doxygen
# will generate a default style sheet. Note that doxygen will try to copy
# the style sheet file to the HTML output directory, so don't put your own
# stylesheet in the HTML output directory as well, or it will be erased!

HTML_STYLESHEET        =

# If the HTML_TIMESTAMP tag is set to YES then the footer of each generated HTML
# page will contain the date and time when the page was generated. Setting
# this to NO can help when comparing the output of multiple runs.

HTML_TIMESTAMP         = YES

# If the HTML_ALIGN_MEMBERS tag is set to YES, the members of classes,
# files or namespaces will be aligned in HTML using tables. If set to
# NO a bullet list will be used.

HTML_ALIGN_MEMBERS     = YES

# If the HTML_DYNAMIC_SECTIONS tag is set to YES then the generated HTML
# documentation will contain sections that can be hidden and shown after the
# page has loaded. For this to work a browser that supports
# JavaScript and DHTML is required (for instance Mozilla 1.0+, Firefox
# Netscape 6.0+, Internet explorer 5.0+, Konqueror, or Safari).

HTML_DYNAMIC_SECTIONS  = NO 


# This tag can be used to set the number of enum values (range [1..20])
# that doxygen will group on one line in the generated HTML documentation.

ENUM_VALUES_PER_LINE   = 4

# The GENERATE_TREEVIEW tag is used to specify whether a tree-like index
# structure should be generated to display hierarchical information.
# If the tag value is set to YES, a side panel will be generated
# containing a tree-like index structure (just like the one that
# is generated for HTML Help). For this to work a browser that supports
# JavaScript, DHTML, CSS and frames is required (i.e. any modern browser).
# Windows users are probably better off using the HTML help feature.

GENERATE_TREEVIEW      = YES 

# By enabling USE_INLINE_TREES, doxygen will generate the Groups, Directories,
# and Class Hierarchy pages using a tree view instead of an ordered list.

USE_INLINE_TREES       = NO

# If the treeview is enabled (see GENERATE_TREEVIEW) then this tag can be
# used to set the initial width (in pixels) of the frame in which the tree
# is shown.

TREEVIEW_WIDTH         = 250

# Use this tag to change the font size of Latex formulas included
# as images in the HTML documentation. The default is 10. Note that
# when you change the font size after a successful doxygen run you need
# to manually remove any form_*.png images from the HTML output directory
# to force them to be regenerated.

FORMULA_FONTSIZE       = 10

# When the SEARCHENGINE tag is enabled doxygen will generate a search box for the HTML output. The underlying search engine uses javascript
# and DHTML and should work on any modern browser. Note that when using HTML help (GENERATE_HTMLHELP), Qt help (GENERATE_QHP), or docsets (GENERATE_DOCSET) there is already a search function so this one should
# typically be disabled. For large projects the javascript based search engine
# can be slow, then enabling SERVER_BASED_SEARCH may provide a better solution.

SEARCHENGINE           = YES

# When the SERVER_BASED_SEARCH tag is enabled the search engine will be implemented using a PHP enabled web server instead of at the web client using Javascript. Doxygen will generate the search PHP script and index
# file to put on the web server. The advantage of the server based approach is that it scales better to large projects and allows full text search. The disadvances is that it is more difficult to setup
# and does not have live searching capabilities.

SERVER_BASED_SEARCH    = NO

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Configuration options related to the dot tool
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# If the CLASS_DIAGRAMS tag is set to YES (the default) Doxygen will
# generate a inheritance diagram (in HTML, RTF and LaTeX) for classes with base
# or super classes. Setting the tag to NO turns the diagrams off. Note that
# this option is superseded by the HAVE_DOT option below. This is only a
# fallback. It is recommended to install and use dot, since it yields more
# powerful graphs.

CLASS_DIAGRAMS         = YES

# If the CLASS_GRAPH and HAVE_DOT tags are set to YES then doxygen
# will generate a graph for each documented class showing the direct and
# indirect inheritance relations. Setting this tag to YES will force the
# the CLASS_DIAGRAMS tag to NO.

CLASS_GRAPH            = YES

# If the COLLABORATION_GRAPH and HAVE_DOT tags are set to YES then doxygen
# will generate a graph for each documented class showing the direct and
# indirect implementation dependencies (inheritance, containment, and
# class references variables) of the class with other documented classes.

COLLABORATION_GRAPH    = YES

# If the GROUP_GRAPHS and HAVE_DOT tags are set to YES then doxygen
# will generate a graph for groups, showing the direct groups dependencies

GROUP_GRAPHS           = YES

# If the UML_LOOK tag is set to YES doxygen will generate inheritance and
# collaboration diagrams in a style similar to the OMG's Unified Modeling
# Language.

UML_LOOK               = NO

# If set to YES, the inheritance and collaboration graphs will show the
# relations between templates and their instances.

TEMPLATE_RELATIONS     = NO

# If the ENABLE_PREPROCESSING, SEARCH_INCLUDES, INCLUDE_GRAPH, and HAVE_DOT
# tags are set to YES then doxygen will generate a graph for each documented
# file showing the direct and indirect include dependencies of the file with
# other documented files.

INCLUDE_GRAPH          = YES

# If the ENABLE_PREPROCESSING, SEARCH_INCLUDES, INCLUDED_BY_GRAPH, and
# HAVE_DOT tags are set to YES then doxygen will generate a graph for each
# documented header file showing the documented files that directly or
# indirectly include this file.

INCLUDED_BY_GRAPH      = YES

# If the CALL_GRAPH and HAVE_DOT options are set to YES then
# doxygen will generate a call dependency graph for every global function
# or class method. Note that enabling this option will significantly increase
# the time of a run. So in most cases it will be better to enable call graphs
# for selected functions only using the \callgraph command.

CALL_GRAPH             = YES 

# If the CALLER_GRAPH and HAVE_DOT tags are set to YES then
# doxygen will generate a caller dependency graph for every global function
# or class method. Note that enabling this option will significantly increase
# the time of a run. So in most cases it will be better to enable caller
# graphs for selected functions only using the \callergraph command.

CALLER_GRAPH           = YES 

# If the GRAPHICAL_HIERARCHY and HAVE_DOT tags are set to YES then doxygen
# will graphical hierarchy of all classes instead of a textual one.

GRAPHICAL_HIERARCHY    = YES

# If the DIRECTORY_GRAPH, SHOW_DIRECTORIES and HAVE_DOT tags are set to YES
# then doxygen will show the dependencies a directory has on other directories
# in a graphical way. The dependency relations are determined by the #include
# relations between the files in the directories.

DIRECTORY_GRAPH        = NO

# The DOT_IMAGE_FORMAT tag can be used to set the image format of the images
# generated by dot. Possible values are png, jpg, or gif
# If left blank png will be used.

DOT_IMAGE_FORMAT       = png

# The tag DOT_PATH can be used to specify the path where the dot tool can be
# found. If left blank, it is assumed the dot tool can be found in the path.

DOT_PATH               = 

# The DOTFILE_DIRS tag can be used to specify one or more directories that
# contain dot files that are included in the documentation (see the
# \dotfile command).

DOTFILE_DIRS           =

# The DOT_GRAPH_MAX_NODES tag can be used to set the maximum number of
# nodes that will be shown in the graph. If the number of nodes in a graph
# becomes larger than this value, doxygen will truncate the graph, which is
# visualized by representing a node as a red box. Note that doxygen if the
# number of direct children of the root node in a graph is already larger than
# DOT_GRAPH_MAX_NODES then the graph will not be shown at all. Also note
# that the size of a graph can be further restricted by MAX_DOT_GRAPH_DEPTH.

DOT_GRAPH_MAX_NODES    = 50

# The MAX_DOT_GRAPH_DEPTH tag can be used to set the maximum depth of the
# graphs generated by dot. A depth value of 3 means that only nodes reachable
# from the root by following a path via at most 3 edges will be shown. Nodes
# that lay further from the root node will be omitted. Note that setting this
# option to 1 or 2 may greatly reduce the computation time needed for large
# code bases. Also note that the size of a graph can be further restricted by
# DOT_GRAPH_MAX_NODES. Using a depth of 0 means no depth restriction.

MAX_DOT_GRAPH_DEPTH    = 0

# Set the DOT_TRANSPARENT tag to YES to generate images with a transparent
# background. This is disabled by default, because dot on Windows does not
# seem to support this out of the box. Warning: Depending on the platform used,
# enabling this option may lead to badly anti-aliased labels on the edges of
# a graph (i.e. they become hard to read).

DOT_TRANSPARENT        = NO

# Set the DOT_MULTI_TARGETS tag to YES allow dot to generate multiple output
# files in one run (i.e. multiple -o and -T options on the command line). This
# makes dot run faster, but since only newer versions of dot (>1.8.10)
# support this, this feature is disabled by default.

DOT_MULTI_TARGETS      = NO

# If the GENERATE_LEGEND tag is set to YES (the default) Doxygen will
# generate a legend page explaining the meaning of the various boxes and
# arrows in the dot generated graphs.

GENERATE_LEGEND        = YES

# If the DOT_CLEANUP tag is set to YES (the default) Doxygen will
# remove the intermediate dot files that are used to generate
# the various graphs.

DOT_CLEANUP            = YES
