PAPI_get_cmp_opt \- Get component specific PAPI options\&.

.PP
\fBParameters\fP
.RS 4
\fIoption\fP is an input parameter describing the course of action\&. Possible values are defined in \fBpapi\&.h\fP and briefly described in the table below\&. The Fortran calls are implementations of specific options\&. 
.br
\fIptr\fP is a pointer to a structure that acts as both an input and output parameter\&. 
.br
\fIcidx\fP An integer identifier for a component\&. By convention, component 0 is always the cpu component\&.

\fBReturn values\fP
.RS 4
\fIPAPI_EINVAL\fP One or more of the arguments is invalid\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBPAPI_get_opt()\fP and \fBPAPI_set_opt()\fP query or change the options of the PAPI library or a specific event set created by \fBPAPI_create_eventset\fP \&. Some options may require that the eventset be bound to a component before they can execute successfully\&. This can be done either by adding an event or by explicitly calling \fBPAPI_assign_eventset_component\fP \&.
.PP
The C interface for these functions passes a pointer to the \fBPAPI_option_t\fP structure\&. Not all options require or return information in this structure, and not all options are implemented for both get and set\&. Some options require a component index to be provided\&. These options are handled explicitly by the \fBPAPI_get_cmp_opt()\fP call for 'get' and implicitly through the option structure for 'set'\&. The Fortran interface is a series of calls implementing various subsets of the C interface\&. Not all options in C are available in Fortran\&.
.PP
\fBNote\fP
.RS 4
Some options, such as PAPI_DOMAIN and PAPI_MULTIPLEX, are also available as separate entry points in both C and Fortran\&.
.RE
.PP
The reader is urged to see the example code in the PAPI distribution for usage of \fBPAPI_get_opt\fP\&. The file \fBpapi\&.h\fP contains definitions for the structures unioned in the \fBPAPI_option_t\fP structure\&.
