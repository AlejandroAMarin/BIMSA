\fBParameters\fP

\fI*rtime\fP realtime since the latest call

\fBReturn values\fP
.RS 4
\fIPAPI_EINVAL\fP The counters were already started by something other than \fBPAPI_ipc()\fP\&. 
.br
\fIPAPI_ENOEVNT\fP The events PAPI_TOT_INS and PAPI_TOT_CYC are not supported\&. 
.br
\fIPAPI_ENOMEM\fP Insufficient memory to complete the operation\&.
.RE
.PP
The first call to \fBPAPI_ipc()\fP will initialize the PAPI interface, set up the counters to monitor PAPI_TOT_INS and PAPI_TOT_CYC events and start the counters\&.
.PP
Subsequent calls will read the counters and return real time, process time, instructions and the IPC rate since the latest call to \fBPAPI_ipc()\fP\&.
.PP
\fBPAPI_ipc()\fP should return a ratio greater than 1\&.0, indicating instruction level parallelism within the chip\&. The larger this ratio the more effeciently the program is running\&. Note that \fBPAPI_ipc()\fP is thread-safe and can therefore be called by multiple threads\&.
