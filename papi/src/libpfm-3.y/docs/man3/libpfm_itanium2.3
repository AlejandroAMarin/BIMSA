.SH DESCRIPTION
The libpfm library provides full support for all the Itanium 2 specific features
of the PMU. The interface is defined in \fBpfmlib_itanium2.h\fR. It consists
of a set of functions and structures which describe and allow access to the 
Itanium 2 specific PMU features.
.sp
The Itanium 2 specific functions presented here are mostly used to retrieve
the characteristics of an event. Given a opaque event descriptor, obtained
by the \fBpfm_find_event()\fR or its derivative functions, they return a boolean value
indicating whether this event support this feature or is of a particular
kind.
.sp
The \fBpfm_ita2_is_ear()\fR function returns 1 if the event
designated by \fBi\fR corresponds to a EAR event, i.e., an Event Address Register
type of events. Otherwise 0 is returned. For instance, \fBDATA_EAR_CACHE_LAT4\fR is an ear event, but 
\fBCPU_CYCLES\fR is not. It can be a data or instruction EAR event.
.sp
The \fBpfm_ita2_is_dear()\fR function returns 1 if the event
designated by \fBi\fR corresponds to an Data EAR event. Otherwise 0 is returned. 
It can be a cache or TLB EAR event.
.sp
The \fBpfm_ita2_is_dear_tlb()\fR function returns 1 if the event
designated by \fBi\fR corresponds to a Data EAR TLB event. Otherwise 0 is returned.
.sp
The \fBpfm_ita2_is_dear_cache()\fR function returns 1 if the event
designated by \fBi\fR corresponds to a Data EAR cache event. Otherwise 0 is returned.
.sp
The \fBpfm_ita2_is_dear_alat()\fR function returns 1 if the event
designated by \fBi\fR corresponds to a ALAT EAR cache event. Otherwise 0 is returned.
.sp
The \fBpfm_ita2_is_iear()\fR function returns 1 if the event
designated by \fBi\fR corresponds to an instruction EAR event. Otherwise 0 is returned. 
It can be a cache or TLB instruction EAR event.
.sp
The \fBpfm_ita2_is_iear_tlb()\fR function returns 1 if the event
designated by \fBi\fR corresponds to an instruction EAR TLB event. Otherwise 0 is returned.
.sp
The \fBpfm_ita2_is_iear_cache()\fR function returns 1 if the event
designated by \fBi\fR corresponds to an instruction EAR cache event. Otherwise 0 is returned.
.sp
The \fBpfm_ita2_support_opcm()\fR function returns 1 if the event
designated by \fBi\fR supports opcode matching, i.e., can this event be measured accurately 
when opcode matching via PMC8/PMC9 is active. Not all events supports this feature.
.sp
The \fBpfm_ita2_support_iarr()\fR function returns 1 if the event
designated by \fBi\fR supports code address range restrictions, i.e., can this event be measured accurately when 
code range restriction is active. Otherwise 0 is returned. Not all events supports this feature.
.sp
The \fBpfm_ita2_support_darr()\fR function returns 1 if the event
designated by \fBi\fR supports data address range restrictions, i.e., can this event be measured accurately when 
data range restriction is active.  Otherwise 0 is returned. Not all events supports this feature.
.sp
The \fBpfm_ita2_get_event_maxincr()\fR function returns in \fBmaxincr\fR the maximum number of
occurrences per cycle for the event designated by \fBi\fR. Certain Itanium 2 events can occur more than 
once per cycle. When an event occurs more than once per cycle, the PMD counter will be incremented accordingly.
It is possible to restrict measurement when event occur more than once per cycle. For instance, 
\fBNOPS_RETIRED\fR can happen up to 6 times/cycle which means that the threshold can be adjusted between 0 and 5, 
where 5 would mean that the PMD counter would be incremented by 1 only when the nop instruction is executed more 
than 5 times/cycle. This function returns the maximum number of occurrences of the event per cycle, and
is the non-inclusive upper bound for the threshold to program in the PMC register.
.sp
The \fBpfm_ita2_get_event_umask()\fR function returns in \fBumask\fR the umask for the event
designated by \fBi\fR.
.sp
The \fBpfm_ita2_get_event_grp()\fR function returns in \fBgrp\fR the group to which the
event designated by \fBi\fR belongs. The notion of group is used for L1 and L2 cache events only.
For all other events, a group is irrelevant and can be ignored. If the event is an L2
cache event then the value of \fBgrp\fR will be \fBPFMLIB_ITA2_EVT_L2_CACHE_GRP\fR. Similarly,
if the event is an L1 cache event, the value of \fBgrp\fR will be \fBPFMLIB_ITA2_EVT_L1_CACHE_GRP\fR.
In any other cases, the value of \fBgrp\fR will be \fBPFMLIB_ITA2_EVT_NO_GRP\fR.
.sp
The \fBpfm_ita2_get_event_set()\fR function returns in \fBset\fR the set to which the
event designated by \fBi\fR belongs. A set is a subdivision of a group and is therefore
only relevant for L1 and L2 cache events. An event can only belong to one group and
one set. This partitioning of the cache events is due to some hardware limitations which
impose some restrictions on events. For a given group, events from different sets 
cannot be measured at the same time. If the event does not belong to a group
then the value of \fBset\fR is \fBPFMLIB_MONT_EVT_NO_SET\fR.
.sp
The \fBpfm_ita2_irange_is_fine()\fR function returns 1 if the configuration description passed
in \fBoutp\fR, the generic output parameters and \fBmod_out\fR, the Itanium2 specific output parameters, 
use code range restriction in fine mode. Otherwise the function returns 0. This function can only be 
called after a call to the \fBpfm_dispatch_events()\fR function returns successfully and had the data
structures pointed to by \fBoutp\fR and \fBmod_out\fR as output parameters.
.sp
The \fBpfm_ita2_get_event_ear_mode()\fR function returns in \fBmode\fR the EAR mode of the
event designated by \fBi\fR. If the event is not an EAR event, then \fBPFMLIB_ERR_INVAL\fR
is returned and mode is not updated. Otherwise mode can have the following values:
.TP
.B PFMLIB_ITA2_EAR_TLB_MODE
The event is an EAR TLB mode. It can be either data or instruction TLB EAR.
.TP
.B PFMLIB_ITA2_EAR_CACHE_MODE
The event is a cache EAR. It can be either data or instruction cache EAR.
.TP
.B PFMLIB_ITA2_EAR_ALAT_MODE
The event is an ALAT EAR. It can only be a data EAR event.
.sp
.LP
When the Itanium 2 specific features are needed to support a measurement their descriptions must be passed
as model-specific input arguments to the \fBpfm_dispatch_events()\fR function. The Itanium 2 specific 
input arguments are described in the \fBpfmlib_ita2_input_param_t\fR structure and the output
parameters in \fBpfmlib_ita2_output_param_t\fR. They are defined as follows:

.SH PER-EVENT OPTIONS
.sp
The Itanium 2 processor provides two additional per-event features for 
counters: thresholding and instruction set selection. They can be set using the 
\fBpfp_ita2_counters\fR data structure for each event.  The \fBism\fR
field can be initialized as follows:
.TP
.B PFMLIB_ITA2_ISM_BOTH 
The event will be monitored during IA-64 and IA-32 execution
.TP
.B PFMLIB_ITA2_ISM_IA32 
The event will only be monitored during IA-32 execution
.TP
.B PFMLIB_ITA2_ISM_IA64 
The event will only be monitored during IA-64 execution
.sp
.LP
If \fBism\fR has a value of zero, it will default to PFMLIB_ITA2_ISM_BOTH.

The \fBthres\fR indicates the threshold for the event. A threshold of \fBn\fR means
that the counter will be incremented by one only when the event occurs more than \fBn\fR
times per cycle.

The \fBflags\fR field contains event-specific flags. The currently defined flags are:
.sp
.TP
PFMLIB_ITA2_FL_EVT_NO_QUALCHECK
When this flag is set it indicates that the library should ignore the qualifiers constraints
for this event. Qualifiers includes opcode matching, code and data range restrictions. When an
event is marked as not supporting a particular qualifier, it usually means that it is ignored, i.e.,
the extra level of filtering is ignored. For instance, the CPU_CYCLES event does not support code
range restrictions and by default the library will refuse to program it if range restriction is also 
requested. Using the flag will override the check and the call to the \fBpfm_dispatch_events()\fR function will succeed. 
In this case, CPU_CYCLES will be measured for the entire program and not just for the code range requested. 
For certain measurements this is perfectly acceptable as the range restriction will only be applied relevant
to events which support it. Make sure you understand which events do not support certain qualifiers before
using this flag.
.LP

.SH OPCODE MATCHING
.sp
The \fBpfp_ita2_pmc8\fR and \fBpfp_ita2_pmc9\fR fields of type \fBpfmlib_ita2_opcm_t\fR contain 
the description of what to do with the opcode matchers. Itanium 2 supports opcode matching via 
PMC8 and PMC9. When this feature is used the \fBopcm_used\fR field must be set to 1, otherwise
it is ignored by the library. The \fBpmc_val\fR simply contains the raw value to store in
PMC8 or PMC9. The library may adjust the value to enable/disable some options depending on the set
of features being used. The final value for PMC8 and PMC9 will be stored in the \fBpfp_pmcs\fR
table of the generic output parameters.

.SH EVENT ADDRESS REGISTERS
.sp
The \fBpfp_ita2_iear\fR field of type \fBpfmlib_ita2_ear_t\fR describes what to do with instruction
Event Address Registers (I-EARs). Again if this feature is used the \fBear_used\fR must be set to 1, 
otherwise it will be ignored by the library. The \fBear_mode\fR must be set to either one of 
\fBPFMLIB_ITA2_EAR_TLB_MODE\fR, \fBPFMLIB_ITA2_EAR_CACHE_MODE\fRto indicate the type of EAR to program.  
The umask to store into PMC10 must be in \fBear_umask\fR. The privilege level mask at which the I-EAR will be 
monitored must be set in \fBear_plm\fR which can be any combination of \fBPFM_PLM0\fR, \fBPFM_PLM1\fR, 
\fBPFM_PLM2\fR, \fBPFM_PLM3\fR.  If \fBear_plm\fR is 0 then the default privilege level mask in \fBpfp_dfl_plm\fR is used. 
Finally the instruction set for which to monitor is in \fBear_ism\fR and can be any one of 
\fBPFMLIB_ITA2_ISM_BOTH\fR, \fBPFMLIB_ITA2_ISM_IA32\fR, or \fBPFMLIB_ITA2_ISM_IA64\fR.
.sp
The \fBpfp_ita2_dear\fR field of type \fBpfmlib_ita2_ear_t\fR describes what to do with data Event Address 
Registers (D-EARs).  The description is identical to the I-EARs except that it applies to PMC11 and
that a \fBear_mode\fR of \fBPFMLIB_ITA2_EAR_ALAT_MODE\fR  is possible.

In general, there are four different methods to program the EAR (data or instruction):
.TP
.B Method 1 
There is an EAR event in the list of events to monitor and \fBear_used\fR is cleared. In this
case the EAR will be programmed (PMC10 or PMC11) based on the information encoded in the event.
A counting monitor (PMC4/PMD4-PMC7/PMD7) will be programmed to count \fBDATA_EAR_EVENT\fR or \fBL1I_EAR_EVENTS\fR
depending on the type of EAR.
.TP
.B Method 2 
There is an EAR event in the list of events to monitor and \fBear_used\fR is set. In this
case the EAR will be programmed (PMC10 or PMC11) using the information in the \fBpfp_ita2_iear\fR or
\fBpfp_ita2_dear\fR structure because it contains more detailed information, such as privilege level and
instruction set.  A counting monitor (PMC4/PMD4-PMC7/PMD7) will be programmed to count DATA_EAR_EVENT or 
L1I_EAR_EVENTS depending on the type of EAR.
.TP
.B Method 3 
There is no EAR event in the list of events to monitor and and \fBear_used\fR is cleared. In this case
no EAR is programmed.
.TP
.B Method 4 
There is no EAR event in the list of events to monitor and and \fBear_used\fR is set. In this case
case the EAR will be programmed (PMC10 or PMC11) using the information in the \fBpfp_ita2_iear\fR or
\fBpfp_ita2_dear\fR structure. This is the free running mode for the EAR.
.sp
.SH BRANCH TRACE BUFFER
The \fBpfp_ita2_btb\fR of type \fBpfmlib_ita2_btb_t\fR field is used to configure the Branch Trace Buffer (BTB). If the 
\fBbtb_used\fR is set, then the library will take the configuration into account, otherwise any BTB configuration will be ignored.
The various fields in this structure provide means to filter out the kind of branches that gets recorded in the BTB.
Each one represents an element of the branch architecture of the Itanium 2 processor. Refer to the Itanium 2 specific
documentation for more details on the branch architecture. The fields are as follows:
.TP
.B btb_ds
If the value of this field is 1, then detailed information about the branch prediction are recorded in place of information about the target
address. If the value is 0, then information about the target address of the branch is recorded instead.
.TP
.B btb_tm
If this field is 0, then no branch is captured. If this field is 1, then non taken branches are captured. If this field is 2, then
taken branches are captured. Finally if this field is 3 then all branches are captured.
.TP
.B btb_ptm
If this field is 0, then no branch is captured. If this field is 1, then branches with a mispredicted target address are captured. If this field 
is 2, then branches with correctly predicted target address are captured. Finally if this field is 3 then all branches are captured regardless of
target address prediction.
.TP
.B btb_ppm
If this field is 0, then no branch is captured. If this field is 1, then branches with a mispredicted path (taken/non taken) are captured. If this field 
is 2, then branches with correctly predicted path are captured. Finally if this field is 3 then all branches are captured regardless of
their path prediction.
.TP
.B btb_brt
If this field is 0, then all branches are captured. If this field is 1, then only IP-relative branches are captured. If this field 
is 2, then only return branches are captured. Finally if this field is 3 then only non-return indirect branches are captured.
.TP
.B btb_plm
This is the privilege level mask at which the BTB captures branches. It can be any combination of \fBPFM_PLM0\fR, \fBPFM_PLM1\fR, \fBPFM_PLM2\fR, 
\fBPFM_PLM3\fR. If \fBbtb_plm\fR is 0 then the default privilege level mask in \fBpfp_dfl_plm\fR is used.
.sp
There are 4 methods to program the BTB and they are as follows:
.sp
.TP
.B Method 1
The \fBBRANCH_EVENT\fR is in the list of event to monitor and \fBbtb_used\fR is cleared. In this case,
the BTB will be configured (PMC12) to record ALL branches. A counting monitor (PMC4/PMD4-PMC7/PMD7) will be programmed to 
count \fBBRANCH_EVENT\fR.
.TP
.B Method 2
The \fBBRANCH_EVENT\fR is in the list of events to monitor and \fBbtb_used\fR is set. In this case,
the BTB will be configured (PMC12) using the information in the \fBpfp_ita2_btb\fR structure. A counting monitor 
(PMC4/PMD4-PMC7/PMD7) will be programmed to count \fBBRANCH_EVENT\fR.
.TP
.B Method 3
The \fBBRANCH_EVENT\fR is not in the list of events to monitor and \fBbtb_used\fR is set. In this case,
the BTB will be configured (PMC12) using the information in the \fBpfp_ita2_btb\fR structure. This is the
free running mode for the BTB.
.TP
.B Method 4
The \fBBRANCH_EVENT\fR is not in the list of events to monitor and \fBbtb_used\fR is cleared. In this case,
the BTB is not programmed.

.SH DATA AND CODE RANGE RESTRICTIONS
The \fBpfp_ita2_drange\fR and \fBpfp_ita2_irange\fR fields control the range restrictions for the data and 
code respectively. The idea is that the application passes a set of ranges, each designated by a start 
and end address. Upon return from the \fBpfm_dispatch_events()\fR function, the application gets back the set of 
registers and their values that needs to be programmed via a kernel interface.

Range restriction is implemented using the debug registers. There is a limited number of debug registers and they go in pair. With
8 data debug registers, a maximum of 4 distinct ranges can be specified. The same applies to code range restrictions. Moreover, there
are some severe constraints on the alignment and size of the ranges. Given that the size of a range is specified using a bitmask, there can
be situations where the actual range is larger than the requested range. For code ranges, the Itanium 2 processor can use what is called a fine mode,
where a range is designated using two pairs of code debug registers. In this mode, the bitmask is not used, the start and end
addresses are directly specified. Not all code ranges qualify for fine mode, the size of the range must be 4KB or less and the range
cannot cross a 4KB page boundary. The library will make a best effort in choosing the right mode for each range. For code ranges,
it will try the fine mode first and will default to using the bitmask mode otherwise. Fine mode applies to all code debug
registers or none, i.e., you cannot have a range using fine mode and another using the bitmask. the Itanium 2 processor somehow limits the use 
of multiple pairs to accurately cover a code range. This can only be done for \fBIA64_INST_RETIRED\fR and even then, you need several
events to collect the counts. For all other events, only one pair can be used, which leads to more inaccuracy due to
approximation. Data ranges can used multiple debug register pairs to gain more accuracy. The library will never cover less than what is
requested. The algorithm will use more than one pair of debug registers
whenever possible to get a more precise range. Hence, up to the 4 pairs can be used to describe a single range. 

If range restriction is to be used, the \fBrr_used\fR field must be set to one, otherwise settings will be ignored. 
The ranges are described by the \fBpfmlib_ita2_input_rr_t\fR structure. Up to 4 ranges can be defined. Each
range is described in by a entry in \fBrr_limits\fR. Some flags for all ranges can be defined in \fBrr_flags\fR.
Currently defined flags are:
.sp
.TP
.B PFMLIB_ITA2_RR_INV
Inverse the code ranges. The qualifying events will be measurement when executing outside the specified
ranges.
.TP
.B PFMLIB_ITA2_RR_NO_FINE_MODE
Force non fine mode for all code ranges (mostly for debug)
.sp
.LP
The \fBpfmlib_ita2_input_rr_desc_t\fR structure is defined as follows:

.TP
.B rr_plm
The privilege level at which the range is active. It can be any combinations of 
\fBPFM_PLM0\fR, \fBPFM_PLM1\fR, \fBPFM_PLM2\fR, \fBPFM_PLM3\fR.  If \fBbtb_plm\fR is 0 then the 
default privilege level mask in \fBpfp_dfl_plm\fR is used. The privilege level is only relevant
for code ranges, data ranges ignores the setting.
.TP
.B rr_start
This is the start address of the range. Any address is supported but for code range it
must be bundle aligned, i.e., 16-byte aligned.
.TP
.B rr_end
This is the end address of the range. Any address is supported but for code range it
must be bundle aligned, i.e., 16-byte aligned.
.sp
.LP

The library will provide the values for the debug registers as well as some information
about the actual ranges in the output parameters and more precisely in the \fBpfmlib_ita2_output_rr_t\fR
structure for each range. The structure is defined as follows:
.TP
.B rr_nbr_used
Contains the number of debug registers used to cover the range. This is necessarily an even number
as debug registers always go in pair. The value of this field  is between 0 and 7.
.TP
.B rr_br
This table contains the list of debug registers necessary to cover the ranges. Each element is 
of type \fBpfmlib_reg_t\fR. The \fBreg_num\fR field contains the debug register index while
\fBreg_value\fR contains the debug register value. Both the index and value must be copied
into the kernel specific argument to program the debug registers. The library never programs them.
.TP
.B rr_infos
Contains information about the ranges defined. Because of alignment restrictions, the actual range
covered by the debug registers may be larger than the requested range. This table describe the differences
between the requested and actual ranges expressed as offsets:
.TP
.B rr_soff
Contains the start offset of the actual range described by the debug registers. If zero, it means
the library was able to match exactly the beginning of the range. Otherwise it represents the number
of byte by which the actual range precedes the requested range.
.TP
.B rr_eoff
Contains the end offset of the actual range described by the debug registers. If zero, it means
the library was able to match exactly the end of the range. Otherwise it represents the number of 
bytes by which the actual range exceeds the requested range.
