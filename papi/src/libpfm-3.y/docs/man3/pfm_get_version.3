level of the library. The version is encoded into an
unsigned integer and returned in the \fBversion\fR argument.

and a minor number. Both can be extracted from the returned
argument using macros provided in the header file:
.TP
.B PFMLIB_MAJ_VERSION(v)
returns the major number encoded in v.
.TP
.B PFMLIB_MIN_VERSION(v)
returns the minor number encoded in v.
.SH RETURN

A return value of \fBPFMLIB_SUCCESS\fR indicates success, 
otherwise the value is the error code.
.SH ERRORS
