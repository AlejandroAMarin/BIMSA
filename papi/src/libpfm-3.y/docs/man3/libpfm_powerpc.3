.SH NAME
libpfm_powerpc - support for IBM PowerPC and POWER processor families
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <perfmon/pfmlib.h>
.B #include <perfmon/pfmlib_powerpc.h>
.sp
.SH DESCRIPTION
The libpfm library provides support for the IBM PowerPC and POWER processor
families.  Specifically, it currently provides support for the following
processors: PPC970(FX,GX), PPC970MP POWER4, POWER4+, POWER5, POWER5+, and POWER6.
.sp
.SH MODEL-SPECIFIC PARAMETERS
At present, the model_in and model_out model-specific input and output
parameters are not used by \fBpfm_dispatch_events()\fR function.  For future
compatibility, NULLs must be passed for these arguments.
.sp
.SH COMBINING EVENTS IN A SET
As with many architecture's PMU hardware design, events can not be combined
together arbitrarily in the same event set, even if there are a sufficient
number of counters available.  This implementation for IBM PowerPC/POWER
bases the event compatibility on a set of previously-defined compatible
event groups.  If the events placed in an event set are all members of one
of the predefined event groups, a call to the \fBpfm_dispatch_events()\fR function will be
successful.  With the current interface, there is no way to discover
apriori which events are compatible, so application software that wishes to
combine events must do so by trial and error, possibly using multiplexed
event sets to count events that cannot otherwise be combined in the same
set.
.sp
.SH ERRORS
Refer to the description of the \fBpfm_dispatch_events()\fR function for errors.
