This directory contains some example programs which illustrate how
the Linux x86 performance-monitoring counters interface may be used.

global/
	Shows how to set up and monitor global-mode perfctrs.
	Fully developed, this would be a perfctr analogue
	of the `top' or `ps' command.

perfex/
	perfex runs another program with user-specified performance
	counter settings, and outputs the final counter values when
	that program terminates.
	perfex is an incomplete clone of IRIX' perfex(1) for MIPS R10000.

self/
	Shows how a program can use the perfctrs to
	monitor the execution in parts of its own code.

signal/
	Illustrates how performance counter overflow can be caught
	and sent to the process as a user-specified signal.
