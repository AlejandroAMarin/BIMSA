powercap_write_test

This test demonstrates the ability of PAPI to use the Linux powercap interface to read and
write power constraints to gather energy information and apply power
constraints.

See the instructions in the components/powercap directory to build the component.

It works by using PAPI to read information from Linux powercap interface and write
it to a file.  The code repeatedly runs an OpenMP multithreaded
routine (primes) to stress the CPU.  The routine is called 100 times,
and at each call the power measurements are read using
PAPI_read(EventSet, values) and printed to a file.  At every 10th call
the power caps for the power packages are adjusted using
PAPI_write(EventSet, values ).

Build and run the test as follows
   cd components/powercap/utils/
   make clean
   make
   ./powercap_write_test

In the output file, you can see the power values that are SET and the
power values that are READ.  By comparing them you can confirm that
the component is performing as expected.
